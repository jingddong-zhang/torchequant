# torchequant
A package finds equant for interpreting the limit-cycle oscillation and finding the analytical phase reduction

# code usage
The title of each directory shows the corresponding limit cycle oscillatory system 

All the machine learning functions are in the file **functions.py**

To reproduce the results, run the code in **dynamics.py** to generate the data over the limit cycle

To train the machine learning framework, run the code in **autoencoder_equant.py** to obtain the homeomorphism between the limit cycle and the unit circle,
and get the parameterised equant, and the extended homeomorphism.

To generate the results, run the **generate.py**.

# Repo update

We upload code and data for three dynamics in this repo for an validation of our Method.
More code and data is available under suitable request to zhangjd20@fudan.edu.cn, and we will open source all the code and data ASAP.
